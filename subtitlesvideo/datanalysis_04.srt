1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,290
Research is a long process that relies on research data.

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,900
Data is created or collected, processed,

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,960
documented,  analyzed, preserved, stored,

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,000
shared, used, re-analyzed and re-used.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,000
It is a fastidious, sometimes repetitive work.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But all of it is necessary for climbing the research ladder.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,680
Up the stairs, one door leads to the research results,

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,750
data analysis can open that door,

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,720
but only if the research data CAN be analyzed.

10
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,500
The research may tumble. The problems causing failure

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,000
are often born during the project youth,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,870
and they are difficult to fix a posteriori.

13
00:00:55,705 --> 00:01:00,000
Research is providing a large amount of valuable data, but,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,240
even when the data is easy to retrieve,

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,300
small problems in its processing

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
can impact tremendously the operability of the data.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Problem which are marginal issues at the start

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
steadily assumes more importance

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
to become huge problems years later:

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The data is there, but it cannot be used or analyzed.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,200
The data become worthless.

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,070
In the end, in order to save the project,

23
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,110
the data needs to be decomposed or cleaned,

24
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,350
a process which is difficult, sometimes dangerous,

25
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,480
and always time consuming.

26
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,590
To plan the use and re-use of the data,

27
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,930
its format must be adapted.

28
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,830
In particular, computer readable digital datasets do

29
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,930
open windows of opportunities, when the unexpected happens.

30
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,170
By planning well ahead how the data will be analyzed,

31
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,170
one can best choose how the data should be collected

32
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,310
such that the data ends in its most well fitted position.

33
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,970
While surprises are always expected,

34
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,970
the dangers are limited when

35
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,090
an adequate file format is chosen.

36
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,090
But even more important than the data,

37
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,400
its documentation must be designed and filled cautiously

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,980
or the data might become pointless.

39
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,500
Research Data Management not only

40
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,500
makes it more convenient to analyze the data,

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,950
but, by introducing standards, it allows the data

42
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,990
to find its place in the research community.

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,660
Moving data from one format to another is a considerable challenge.

44
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,990
Even interoperable and machine readable data

45
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,200
is tricky to migrate.

46
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,960
It does not come without danger either.

47
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,480
It is easy to underestimate the problem,

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,520
it is tempting to think one will craft something later.

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,550
But "later" might become "too late".

50
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,370
Sometimes the data must be re-evaluated completely.

51
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,370
Sometimes, with a lot of luck and efforts,

52
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,270
the data can be saved.

53
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,670
But counting on luck is not very sound, is it?

54
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,380
Instead, start early with your research data management

55
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,420
Make a data management plan, it is a witty move!

56
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,420
Get training, master the data life cycle,

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,420
make your spreadsheets tidy, document your data flow.

58
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,420
Be a researcher and a research data manager.

59
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,960
And in five years, your data will be easy to analyze

60
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,270
and share.
