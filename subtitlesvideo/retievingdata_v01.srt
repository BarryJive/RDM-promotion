1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,060
Researchers do love their data

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,900
And if their data are lost, the dance stops.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,500
While researchers can avoid

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,540
the crash of a complete data loss by creating backups,

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,960
proper data management goes

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,080
beyond just preventing a crash.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,060
Today, data are accumulating faster and faster

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,360
While packaging their data for

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,700
future analysis, reuse, and sharing,

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,220
researchers often lack a proper system.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,000
This strategy may work for a time

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,820
but when the amount and complexity of datasets increases,

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,530
researchers can put themselves in real danger!

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,520
Because you do not want to waste days sorting out your data,

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,980
you shall master data safety, organization, naming and computer readability.

16
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:05,920
Then, the research process happens smoothly and efficiently.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,780
If you want to master data management and increase your efficiency, look for help at a Research Data Management Helpdesk or online.

18
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:29,730
In the next episode, we will see how research data management can help you with your data analysis, so stay tuned!
