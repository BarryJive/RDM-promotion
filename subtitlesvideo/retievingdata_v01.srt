1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,060
The researchers do love their data

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,900
And if the data is lost, the dance stops

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,500
While researchers can avoid

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,540
the crash of a complete data loss by doing backups.

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,960
proper data management goes

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,080
beyond just preventing a crash

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,060
Data is accumulating fast

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,360
While packing their data for

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,700
future analysis, reuse, and sharing,

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,220
the researchers often lack a system.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,000
This strategy may work on the short term

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,820
but when the amound and complexity of datasets increase,

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,530
the researchers put themselves in danger !

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,520
Because you do not want to spend days sorting out your data,

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,980
you shall master data safety, organization, naming and computer readability.

16
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:05,920
Then, the process happens smoothly and efficiently.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,780
You want to master data management and increase your efficiency, seek for help at a research data management helpdesk or online.

18
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:29,730
In the next episode, we will see how research data management can help you to produce easier and powerful data analysis, so stay tuned !
