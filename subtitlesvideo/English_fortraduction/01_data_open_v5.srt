1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,880
Research data should be free, shareable, and re-usable.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,700
Only when open, it will reach its true potential.

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,320
Fostering collaboration, open data accelerates research,

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,610
even years after its production, by allowing easy preliminary and meta-analyses,

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,800
it can put research on the right track.

6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,780
Open data provides a bulletproof defense

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,120
against accusations of misconduct or bad scientific practices.

8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,740
Open data increases research visibility and citations,

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,980
and when well organised, open data can also speed up the research process.

10
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,060
Trustworthy results are efficiently and safely delivered,

11
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,320
and the research gets more chance to be published and funded.

12
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,820
Governments, funding agencies, universities, and publishers

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,540
have recognised the importance of opening up research data.

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,420
and now, they often REQUEST it, and rightfully so.

15
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,700
But producing open data does not come without difficulties,

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,960
it can require a modification of the research workflow,

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,340
a process that does not come without pain and effort.

18
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:32,480
But once data management has been implemented, opening data is effortless.

19
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,760
By default, the data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable,

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,340
and can be made open by the press of a button.

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,380
In the end, good research always wins!

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,240
When the times comes, it is a job for researchers.

23
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,700
For their careers and for society, they have to unleash their data:

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,580
they must make it open and FAIR,

25
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:05,220
And their open FAIR data will fly away and save the day.

26
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:13,984
If you want to master data management and produce open data, look for help at a Research Data Management Helpdesk or online!

28
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:28,498
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:28,498
In the next episode, we will see how Research Data Management can help you retrieve your data, so stay tuned!
