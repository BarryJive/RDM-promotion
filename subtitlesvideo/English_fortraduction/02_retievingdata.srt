00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,860
Why research data management 2/4:
Retrieving Data

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,060
Researchers do love their data

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,040
And if their data are lost, the dance stops.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,700
While researchers can avoid

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,940
the crash of a complete data loss by creating backups,

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,140
proper data management goes

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,080
beyond just preventing a crash.

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,800
Today, data are accumulating faster and faster

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,440
While packaging their data for future analysis, reuse, and sharing,

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,820
researchers often lack a proper system.

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,000
This strategy may work for a time

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,160
but when the amount and complexity of datasets increases,

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,020
researchers can put themselves in real danger!

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,000
Because you do not want to waste days sorting out your data,

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,980
you shall master data safety, organization, naming and computer readability.

16
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,580
Then, the research process happens smoothly and efficiently.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:14,057
If you want to master data management and increase your efficiency, look for help at a Research Data Management Helpdesk or online.
