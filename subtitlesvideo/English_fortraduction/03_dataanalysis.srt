00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,080
Why research data management 1/4:
Analysing data

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,290
Research is a long process that often relies on data.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,060
Data are collected, documented, processed,

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,120
preserved, shared, and archived.

5
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:22,640
It is a long, intricate, and sometimes repetitive work process.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,540
But all of it is necessary for climbing the research ladder,

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,760
and getting to the last step to the results:

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,420
the data analysis.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,180
But analyses will fail with data that lacks high quality.

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,880
The research may tumble. The errors that produce problems

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,600
are often born during the early stage of a project.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,540
Research provides a large amount of valuable data, but,

13
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,440
even when the data are easy to retrieve,

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,080
small problems in its processing

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,220
can have a tremendous impact on the operability of the data.

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,480
Problems which are marginal issues at the start

17
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,580
steadily gain more importance.

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,260
The data are there, but they cannot be used or analyzed properly.

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,900
The data become worthless.

20
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,180
In the end, in order to save the project,

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,860
the data need to be decomposed or cleaned,

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,180
a process which is often difficult, sometimes dangerous,

23
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,120
and always time consuming.

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,200
By planning well ahead how the data will be analyzed,

25
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,260
one can best choose how the data should be collected

26
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,280
such that the data ends in its optimal position.

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,980
While surprises can always be expected,

28
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,820
the dangers are limited when an adequate file format is chosen.

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,740
But even more important than the data,

30
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,420
is its documentation, which must be cautiously designed and entered

31
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,620
or the data might become pointless.

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,740
Moving data from one format to another for its analysis is a considerable challenge.

33
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,940
Even computer readable data is tricky to migrate.

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,860
It is easy to underestimate the problem,

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,260
and it is tempting to think you will craft something later.

36
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,720
But "later" might become "too late".

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,640
There is a risk of total data loss.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,460
Sometimes, with a lot of luck and efforts,

39
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,289
the data can be saved.

40
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,760
And sometimes not.

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,460
Because you do not want to evaluated or collected your data again:

42
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,990
Write a plan, document every step, produce tidy datasets.

43
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,240
Data management will make your data easy to analyze,

44
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,280
share, and re-use.

45
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:23,000
