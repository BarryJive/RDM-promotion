1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
We wasted our time during data analysis

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,350
We had a paper rejected because the raw data were lost

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,220
We did lose our data

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,660
We trashed data we could not make sense of

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,160
We failed to recognize open data as the new standard

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,900
Never again!

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,070
We want Better Research

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,310
In less time

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,410
in order to produce open FAIR data and foster collaboration.

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,890
Those are the promises of Data Management.
