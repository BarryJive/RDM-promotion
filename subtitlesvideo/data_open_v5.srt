1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:11,600
Research data should be free, shareable, and re-usable.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,470
Only when open will it reach its true potential.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,510
Fostering collaboration, open data accelerates research,

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,610
even years after its production, by allowing easy preliminary and meta-analyses,

5
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,180
it can put research on the right track.

6
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,490
Open data provides a bulletproof defense

7
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,290
against accusations of misconduct or bad scientific practices.

8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,560
Open data increases your research visibility and citations,

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,640
and when well organised, open data can also speed up the research process.

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,710
Trustworthy results are efficiently and safely delivered,

11
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,680
and the research gets more chance to be published and funded.

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,480
Governments, funding agencies, universities, and publishers

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,590
have recognised the importance of opening up research data.

14
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,420
and now, they often REQUEST it, and rightfully so.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,700
But producing open data does not come without difficulties,

16
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,600
it can require you to modify your research workflow,

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,370
a process that does not come without pain and effort.

18
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:34,250
But once data management has been implemented, opening data is effortless.

19
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,210
By default, the data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable,

20
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,590
and can be made open by the press of a button.

21
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,660
In the end, good research always wins!

22
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,060
When the times comes, it is a job for researchers.

23
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:56,700
For their careers and for society, they have to unleash their data:

24
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,103
they must make it open and FAIR,

25
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:03,740
And their open FAIR data will fly away and save the day.

26
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:14,651
If you want to master data management and produce open data, look for help at a Research Data management helpdesk or online!

27
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:28,765
In our next episode, we will see how Research Data management can help you retrieve your data, so stay tuned.
