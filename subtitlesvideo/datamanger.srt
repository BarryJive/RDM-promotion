We lost our data
We wasted our time during data analysis
We had a paper rejected because the raw data were lost
We trashed data we could not make sense of
and We failed - to recognize open data as the new standard

but never again.

we want
Better Research
In less time
in order to produce 
open FAIR data and foster collaboration.

Those are the promises of
Data management.
