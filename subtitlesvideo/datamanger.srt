We did lose data
We did waste time during data analysis
We had a paper rejected because the raw data was lost
We did trash data we could not make sense of
and We failed - to regonize open data as the new standard

but never again.

we want
Better Research
In less time
in order to produce 
open FAIR data and foster collaboration.

That's the promises of
Data management.
