1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,290
Research is a long process that relies on research data.

2
00:00:09,826 --> 00:00:13,860
Data is collected, documented, processed,

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,035
preserved, shared, and archived,

4
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:22,640
It is a long, fastidious, sometimes repetitive work.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,860
But all of it is necessary for climbing the research ladder,

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,280
getting to the final door before the results:

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,185
The data analysis.

8
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:39,320
But analysis fails with data lacking quality.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,100
The research may tumble. The problems causing failure

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,600
are often born during the project youth.

11
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,090
Research is providing a large amount of valuable data, but,

12
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,330
even when the data is easy to retrieve,

13
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,400
small problems in its processing

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,100
can impact tremendously the operability of the data.

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,110
Problems which are marginal issues at the start

16
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,110
steadily assumes more importance

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,080
The data is there, but it cannot be used or analyzed.

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,050
The data become worthless.

19
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,720
In the end, in order to save the project,

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,190
the data needs to be decomposed or cleaned,

21
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,200
a process which is difficult, sometimes dangerous,

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,711
and always time consuming.

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,760
By planning well ahead how the data will be analyzed,

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,760
one can best choose how the data should be collected

25
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,900
such that the data ends in its most well fitted position.

26
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,570
While surprises are always expected,

27
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,570
the dangers are limited when

28
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,870
an adequate file format is chosen.

29
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,880
But even more important than the data,

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,180
its documentation must be designed and filled cautiously

31
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,790
or the data might become pointless.

32
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,450
Moving data from one format to another for its analysis

33
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,780
is a considerable challenge. Even computer readable data

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,990
is tricky to migrate.

35
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,260
It is easy to underestimate the problem,

36
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,300
it is tempting to think one will craft something later.

37
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,340
But "later" might become "too late".

38
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,180
Sometimes the data must be re-evaluated completely.

39
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,180
Sometimes, with a lot of luck and efforts,

40
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,050
the data can be saved.

41
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,940
But counting on luck is not very sound, is it?

42
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,650
Instead, start early with your research data management:

43
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:07,990
Write a plan, document every step, produce tidy datasets:

44
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,230
Be clever and your data will be easy to analyze

45
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,540
and share.
