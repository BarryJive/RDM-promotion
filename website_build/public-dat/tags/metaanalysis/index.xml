      <description>Tim working at his computer. Two others speaking:
 What is Tim doing? Meta-analysis. whaa Cool, he is comparing his results with the data of other scientists got all over the world during the last 10 years? No that&amp;rsquo;s what the computer of Amanda, who is drinking coffee there is being doing&amp;hellip; Tim is just trying to compare his data, with the data he obtained two years ago.

      <description>In 2007, I entered a lab doing mainly one experiment: olfactory learning assay in fruit fly. The output of the experiment is the number of flies choosing one or the other odor, recorded manually on spreadsheets. For the 14 people in the lab, they were approximately 20 different spreadsheets around. We managed to create one tidy template for all experiments in about 6 months. Interestingly, it took 2-3 of us to design the first draft, we then gathered feedback from the whole group, get a second version and so on.</description>
