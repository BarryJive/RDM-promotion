      <description>The idea is to represent the idea that data archive is not putting the data in a place where nobody will ever look at it, but showing it to the world.
The idea is to represent a building, with a scienctist working at its computer and pushing the &amp;ldquo;archive the data&amp;rdquo; button. Then it would show someone in the basement shovelling data into the corners, which a voice over stating that it is what people think archiving is.</description>

      <description>Topic: rdm for data analysis
template: Start with sth positive. one-liner problem. get the fixed content for all videos (time travel, rdm professional ,&amp;hellip;?)
explain what can be done to fix the problem.
Script: &amp;ldquo;It took a while for the scripts to run. I can still remember sitting there listening to the screeching sounds of the computer. And then one by one I got the results, and they all confirmed my hypothesis.</description>

      <description>The inspiration comes from ARTE: https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/RC-015330/propaganda/ (french) https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/RC-015330/moneypulation/ (german), and I talk about the format, not the content :)
The idea is to create mashup videos, i.e. videos where the images are unrelated to the content but bring humor or a different perspective to what the voice off is saying. There is a lot of free to reuse videos available to do it.
The strategy to make some is to first write a script for the voice off and then look for the videos.</description>

      <description>A scientist is sitting in the cafeteria, we ear people chatting:
 Do you know, you need to provide your data when you publish? The data should be in a state where it can be re-used. And each scientist is responsible for dealing with his data.  The scientist says: &amp;ldquo;That is bullshit: who is saying that?&amp;rdquo;
 Our main funders (DFG) Our favorite publishers Our employer, the university, is, too!</description>

      <description>Narrator&amp;rsquo;s voice: Once upon a time, in the kingdom of academia, there worked a scientist. S/he worked night and day to collect the best, most reliable data in his/her field. Months of hard work went by. Until one day an evil spell was cast upon the kingdom. All the the research data with no backup should be lost forever!
&amp;ldquo;Why, oh why did I not backup my data?!&amp;rdquo; the researcher cried.</description>

No that&amp;rsquo;s what the computer of Amanda, who is drinking coffee there is being doing&amp;hellip; Tim is just trying to compare his data, with the data he obtained two years ago.
