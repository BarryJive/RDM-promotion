Tim working at his computer. two others speaking:
What is Tim doing? Meta-analysis. whaa Cool, he is comparing his results with the data of other scientists got all over the world during the last 10 years? No that’s what the computer of Amanda, who is drinking coffee there is being doing… Tim is just trying to compare his data, with the data he obtained two years ago.

      <description>name: julien Colomb
http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3127-5520
position at the time: scientist
 In 2007, I entered a lab doing mainly one experiment: olfactory learning assay in fruit fly. The output of the experiment is the number of flies choosing one or the other odor, recorded manually on spreadsheets. For the 14 people in the lab, they were approximately 20 different spreadsheets around. We managed to create one tidy template for all experiments in about 6 months.</description>

      <description>During the second week of march, I had the chance to participate to two interesting meetings: the open science barcamp and the premierquality seminar. Both events have some online archive with results of discussion for the barcamp (https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/oscibar2018) and slides of the presentations for the seminar (https://www.bihealth.org/de/quest-center/projekte/premier/news/). I was stroked by the similarity in the discourses, not only concerning the problems discussed but also the solutions proposed.
Here is the first of a series of blog about the parallel between the two events and communities.</description>
