# Let's build awesome promotion material for RDM, together !

>Thank you for considering a contribution to this project. We would like this process to be as frictionless as possible, while giving as much credit for your input as possible. As explained in our code of conduct, we also want to be as inclusive as possible. For instance, we would be happy to publish material for you if you feel not confident in writing or writing under your name.
Feel welcome to contact us for any question or request.

## What is it for you?

All content created in this project will be distributed under a CC0 or CC-BY license: helping us making awesome material will provide you (and all the others) with awesome material. These are the principles of open FAIR data and open science, and (at least for those of you who are teaching these principles) you do probably believe in them.

In addition, you will be listed in the contributor list and your institution may be listed in the supporter list. You will also be listed as an author of the repository on the zenodo archive of this project, unless you specify you do not want to.



## How can you help ?

1. **Give us feedback**: Something is bothering you with this project, or you have a question? Open an github issue or contact us via email. Every feedback will be considered as a gift, especially negative ones. You may also look at existing issues and see whether you can help with one of them. In addition, you may browse the stories and ideas on the website and add your thoughts and comments via the website functionalities.

1. **Complete the list of Promotion material** You know of some material that is not on the list? Please add it to the google speadsheet: 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ybqL2WNdJZb7nwEAJ6yWJ0W95D3CtyEkQ97DFcJydsk/edit?usp=sharing. Enter at least the url linking to that video, image, comics,etc. Feel free to fill the other columns or to left it blank, another member of the team will fill it later. 

2. **Share your best RDM life-story**. Share one or several of your favorite experience with RDM (how we manage to convince a scientist, how RDM saved your project, your stress of nearly loosing your data, your super-hero feeling when you could provide a scientist with his own data he had lost,...) To this end, you may use the github comment function here on REFISSUE. In contrast, if you would like it to be an anonymous addition, if you would like us to copy-edit or translate your text or if you would prefer to talk to us, please contact us via email and we will find a way.

3. **Help with new material creation**. We are still in a fuzzy stage of the development of new material, any help would be greatly appreciated (script ideas, concept ideas, putative partners, workflow idea...). Any comment can be sent via email or via github issues.
