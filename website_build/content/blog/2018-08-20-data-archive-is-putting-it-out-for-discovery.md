The idea is to represent the idea that data archive is not putting the data in a place where nobody will ever look at it, but showing it to the world.

The idea is to represent a building, with a scienctist working at its computer and pushing the "archive the data" button. Then it would show someone in the basement shovelling data into the corners, which a voice over stating that it is what people think archiving is.

Then it would move into a representation of what it is, labelling the data (with metadata) and putting it somewhere where everyone can access it. The image could be linked to the library, or find an allegory (pinning in the sky?).
