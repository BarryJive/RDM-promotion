A scientist is sitting in the cafeteria, we ear people chatting:

- Do you know, you need to provide your data when you publish?
- The data should be in a state where it can be re-used.
- And each scientist is responsible for dealing with his data.

The scientist says: "That is bullshit: who is saying that?"

- Our main funders (DFG)
- Our favorite publishers
- Our employer, the university, is, too!

scientist, panicking:
- But that will necessite a enormous amount of time !!! I do not have time for this! 

- It's ok you know, it is not that difficult and it is not time-consuming: if you start early and get a system to manage your data, you might even get rid of bad habits and save time in the end.

- But, but, I am a scientist, not a data manager!

- Ask for help and get training, if there is an helpdesk at your university, call them.
