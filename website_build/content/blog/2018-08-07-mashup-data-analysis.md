explain what can be done to fix the problem.

"It took a while for the scripts to run. I can still remember sitting there listening to the screeching sounds of the computer. And then one by one I got the results, and they all confirmed my hypothesis. It was great. It was a small piece of scientific knowledge, but I was the first person in the world to know about it." so speaks Keren Limor-Waisberg when asked for her happiest data moment.

*Beginn transmission*

*1. data management for data analysis*

v1: time machine

Dear myself, I have sent us this message through time. If my calculations are right, you will receive this message a bit before starting your PhD. The transmission may be stopped any time, my message is simple: call the Research data management helpdesk, let them help you! .

*Put the data in a format the future you will be able to analyse.*


I went to a data analyst and told him I had a few excel sheets to analyse, he has just faked death to avoid having to deal with our mess. I don't blame him.
Because the data analysis is the last steps before getting scientific answers, you think it will go smoothly, like I did! If only I knew: a successful and efficient analysis is prepared before data acquisition starts. 
 
So: design our analysis first, accordingly, plan  
what variables to record, what digital format to use, how and where to save the data. For our spreadsheet data, use a tidy format, please keep away from nice looking charts, believe me, we will need computer readable tables. 

I remember that you have no clue about this, but don't panick, the research data management helpdesk of the university already exists. You only need to give them a call. I have wasted so much time, please save us the pain. Get it right, for me, for us.

And also, we will need to combine our data with our colleagues', so please do not forget to r...

V2: Data manager fairy

What to do to get data in a state where it is easy to analyse? No problem, I am coming right away, with my magical book and wand.

*Prepare data for analysis*

V3: datq manager as super hero:

It took a while for the scripts to run. I can still remember sitting there listening to the screeching sounds of the computer. And then one by one I got... Oh no! there are problems with the data!

In blackest drawers, in brightest delight
No data shall escape my sight. 
Let those who start their research fight
listen to my advice… data managers’ light.

Know how your data will be analysed before you start collecting it!
You will then be better armed to plan and choose how you will collect the data, in which format you will digitalise it, and how you will organise and save it. 

Beware, you might be a lucky researcher and someone already created standard data formats and analysis tools that you can use. Look for it.

And remember, you might need to combine different datasets to answer your question. Make your data ready for it: use or create standard vocabularies, plan data conversions and do not forget to...

Want to know more, check at your institutions how you can get personal conselling.
