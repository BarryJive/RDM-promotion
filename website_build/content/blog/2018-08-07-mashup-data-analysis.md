"I had a lot of data and it took a while for the scripts to run. It was nerve-racking. I can still remember sitting there listening to the screeching sounds of the computer. And then one by one I got the results, and they all confirmed my hypothesis. It was great. It was a small piece of scientific knowledge, but I was the first person in the world to know about it." so speaks Keren Limor-Waisberg when asked for her happiest data moment.

*1. data management for data analysis*

v1: time machine

Dear me, I have sent you this message through time. If my calculations are right, you will receive this message a bit before starting your PhD. The transmission may be stopped any time, my message is simple: call the Research data management helpdesk, let them help you! .

*Put the data in a format the future you will be able to analyse.*


I went to a data analyst and told him I had a few excel sheets to analyse, he has just faked death to avoid having to deal with our mess. I don't blame him.
Because the data analysis is the last steps before getting scientific answers, you think it will go smoothly! If only I knew: a successful and efficient analysis is prepared before data acquisition starts. 
 
So: design our analysis first, accordingly, plan  
what variables to record, what digital format to use, how and where to save the data. For our spreadsheet data, use a tidy format, please keep away from nice looking charts, believe me, we will need computer readable tables. 

I have wasted so much time transforming data from one format to another, please save us the pain. I have lost critical information during the process and this time machine is my last hope to get the analysis through. Please get it right, for me, for us.

I remember that you have no clue about this, but don't panick, the research data management helpdesk of the university already exists. You only need to give them a call. 

And also, we will need to combine our data with our colleagues, so please use standards and do not forget to record the...
