"It was a small piece of scientific knowledge, but I was the first person in the world to know about it." so speaks xxx when asked for her happiest data moment. Because the data analysis is the last steps before getting such answers, one indeed tend to forget that successful analysis is the results of a process starting way before data acquisition.

Once you have decided of a strategy to answer your question, a bunch of technical questions can be tackled. Successful, trusworthy analysis are indeed designed before the data is aquired. This design has implications on how the data will be acquired and saved, and how much data will be collected. The sooner these questions are answered, the less time is wasted in transforming data from one format to another.

As a scientisit, you were probably not prepared to deal with these problems, and we, research data managers, are here to help. Look at your institution for data steward options.
