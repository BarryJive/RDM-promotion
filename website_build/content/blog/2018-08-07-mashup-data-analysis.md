"It took a while for the scripts to run. I can still remember sitting there listening to the screeching sounds of the computer. And then one by one I got the results, and they all confirmed my hypothesis. It was great.

So: design our analysis first, accordingly, plan  
what variables to record, what digital format to use, how and where to save the data. For our spreadsheet data, use a tidy format, please keep away from nice looking charts, believe me, we will need computer readable tables. 

I remember that you have no clue about this, but don't panick, the research data management helpdesk of the university already exists. You only need to give them a call. I have wasted so much time, please save us the pain. Get it right, for me, for us.

And also, we will need to combine our data with our colleagues', so please do not forget to r...
