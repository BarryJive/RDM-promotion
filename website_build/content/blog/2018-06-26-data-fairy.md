Narrator's voice: Once upon a time, in the kingdom of academia, there worked a scientist. S/he worked night and day to collect the best, most reliable data in his/her field. Months of hard work went by. Until one day an evil spell was cast upon the kingdom. All the the research data with no backup should be lost forever!

"Why, oh why did I not backup my data?!" the researcher cried.
All of a sudden, a data management fairy appeared. -lists data backup options-

And the scientist and his/her data lived happily ever after.
