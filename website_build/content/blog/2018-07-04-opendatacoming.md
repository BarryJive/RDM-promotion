Open data is coming, here are some data to backup this claim:


Carlos Moedas â€“ Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation - said on 22 June 2015:


>This will mean setting standards for the management, interoperability and quality of scientific data. I would like to see progress on this in next 12 months. And I will want to see what further support or requirements for open data should be introduced in Horizon 2020 following the mid term review.
