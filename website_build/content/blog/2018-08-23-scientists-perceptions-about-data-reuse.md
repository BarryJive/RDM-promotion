modified from http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2018/03/20/what-factors-do-scientists-perceive-as-promoting-or-hindering-scientific-data-reuse/ and the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0189288 (http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189288)

Interesting conclusions:
1. researchers who re-use the data are different from researchers making data open for reuse
2. expressed lack of trust in reused data was not a factor explaining a lack of data reuse: while trust is a problem per se, it does not impeede data reuse.
3. there is a correlation between data reuse and perceived efficacy of data reuse (in contrast to the authors, I am not infering in which direction this might be causal).
4. researchers knowning about metadata have different perceptions: the perception they have of the norm (what one is supposed to do) has a bigger effect on their data reuse. My interpretation is that they know that the cost is not so high.
