While previous video were online for some time, I have worked the concept a bit and end up with 4 videos so far. The first one is about open data and features superman. 

The second one is about using RDM to be sure to be able to retrieve one's data and work more efficiently. It features Popeye.

The third one is a general introduction about the main pitfalls RDM aims at avoiding, ending with a positive thinking: "we want better research in less time, while producing open FAIR data".

The fourth one presents why RDM makes data analysis better, safer and faster. It features Buston Keaton's movie.

Late February, the videos will enter sound production with a professional voice over, music, sound effects and mix. SO HURRY IF YOU WANT TO GIVE FEEDBACK ON THE VIDEOS OT TEXT. I hope you will be able to use it.
