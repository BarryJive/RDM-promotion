The very first [Data Management Engagement Award](http://www.rdmengagementaward.org/), a competition sponsored by SPARC Europe, the University of Cambridge and Jisc to elicit new and imaginative ideas for engaging researchers in the practices of good Research Data Management (RDM).

Our proposal is to link RDM with the open science movement via the Wikimedia suite of tools.

Basically just share yours or others’ openly licensed research material via Wikimedia Commons to create an aggregated resource that can be used to improve Wikipedia. It’s easy!

To read more about the project and register your interest please visit [this shared Google folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-bnrdFS4dq-IQ-7Ry9jAzZlhZvxKm4JL) which includes the original proposal and a preliminary project plan.
