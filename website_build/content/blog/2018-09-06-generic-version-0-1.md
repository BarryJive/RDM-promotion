Here we are, the first real output of this outreach eeFDM project is here, have a look at our video available on figshare at
 https://figshare.com/s/e2b14570b5991931c92c
 
It will be used as a generic (front credit) for longer videos with more content, we will (probably) start with a video about how rdm can save you time when the data is analysed.
 
Please tell us one thing you would like to be different (either in the comments, on github or per email, see [the contribrute page](../../../../../contribute/)).

Text of the generic:
We did - waiste time during data formating for analysis
We did - loose data
We had - a paper rejected because we could not locate the raw data
We did - throw data because we could not make sense of it
We failed - to regonize open data as the new standard

Data managment will help you.
