Here we are, the first real output of this outreach eeFDM project is here, have a look at our video available on figshare at
 https://figshare.com/s/e2b14570b5991931c92c

![The video clip is 40 sec long](/blog/2018-09-06-generic-version-0-1_files/generic_tumb.jpg)
 
It will be used as a generic (front credit) for longer videos with more content, we will probably start with a video about how rdm can save you time when the data is analysed.
 
Do you think you will use the video on your website and talks? Tell us why. In particular is there anything you would want different for you to use the video?
(either in the comments, on github or per email, see [the contribrute page](../../../../../contribute/)). 

For example, how do you feel with the black and white desighn, whould we use colors at some point? Do you like the script and text?

#### Text of the generic (typos corrected):

We did - waste time during data formating for analysis

We did - lose data

We had - a paper rejected because we could not locate the raw data

We did - throw data away because we could not make sense of it

We failed - to recognize open data as the new standard

Data management will help you.

Better Research - organize your digital data and perform easier, reproducible analysis 
In less time - get digital skills, work smarter
open data - foster collaboration, become a leader and spread the word.
