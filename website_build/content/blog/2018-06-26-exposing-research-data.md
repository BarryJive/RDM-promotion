In my work, I am the developer and administrator of a web based information system for research data applied in more than 30 research projects to share collected, brought or created data within the project consortium and with stakeholders. Even single researcher e.g. PhD students use the system to organize their own data. While most datasets can be downloaded without any extra request, few datasets can only be downloaded after the dataset owner approval. Working as that administrator, I could then see that **some datasets are still downloaded years after the end of the initial project**, which demonstrate the benefits of provisioning, exposing and sharing of research data.
