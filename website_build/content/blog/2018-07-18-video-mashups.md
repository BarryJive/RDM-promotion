The inspiration comes from ARTE: https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/RC-015330/propaganda/ (french) 
https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/RC-015330/moneypulation/ (german), and I talk about the format, not the content :)

The idea is to create mashup videos, i.e. videos where the images are unrelated to the content but bring humor or a different perspective to what the voice off is saying.
There is a lot of free to reuse videos available to do it.

The strategy to make some is to first write a script for the voice off and then look for the videos. (information taken from an interview of Leo Favier, the author of the ARTE mashup)
