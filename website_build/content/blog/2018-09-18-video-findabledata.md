talk:
I am ... working here. under roman supervision
project: aim = videos, ways = open 
you might have seen the discrepency between what OS advocates say and what they do, I was no exception,
but I try to be better and therefore, I did... (4 steps)
results = 1 website, video, images listed

We did - waste time during data analysis

We did - lose data

We had - a paper rejected because we could not locate the raw data

We did - throw data away because we could not make sense of it

We failed - to recognize open data as the new standard

But Never again !

we want Better Research 
In less time 
while producing open fair data 

and that is indeed the promise of 
Data management

# Introduction

(dancing popeye)
Researchers do love their data, and if the data is lost, the dance stops.

An hardware crash is a feared sceniario, Researchers will panick if their data cannot be retrieved. But data management goes beyond having data copies and backups.

(order-olive)

Indeed, data is accumulating fast. 
Packing the data for future analysis or sharing, researchers often lack a system. The strategy may work short term, with little data, but on the long term, the researcher put himself in danger, and even if the data is not completely lost, it might takes ages to locate it later.

(lion)
You may think your data will stand out and will be easy to find, but the reality is that your digitalised data will blend in and no one will scream at its view. The most important your piece of data is, the most important it is to put it on a leash, and that leash is called metadata. 

(popeye order made)

But if you master data safety, naming, organisation and computer readability, the whole process happens smoothly and efficiently. 


Put your data on a leash with data management.

## 1. Data folder organisation

In three years, you will probably need access to the data you are collecting now, and in three years, you will have produced a lot more data: it might be difficult to find your files again.
Diverse solution need to be implemented to facilitate the task. 
Using a heirarchy of folders to organsise your files is one of them. For instance, you can use one folder per project, as well as subfolders for raw data, secondary data, analyses and reports. In any case, writing a readme file explaining how the data is organised makes it easier and faster to understand where is which version of the data and analysis.


## 2. Data file naming

File names should be as short as possible, as long as necessary, i.e. they should be self explanatory. Never use special characters like spaces or points. 
Use conventions for naming your files, and make sure you and your co-workers are using the same ones.
Pro tip: If you want to use dates, use the standard yyyymmdd, such that sorting files by their names will correspond to their chronology. 

## 3. Data index and metadata

Conventions are good, but they are nearly always failing. A practical way to go around the problem is to create an index of files, where metadata information can be added and which can be read by a computer. Small programs will be able to reach to the data only by reading the index and operations like concatenating tabular data, joining tables, analysing data and producing figures (for the production of manuscript, presentation and poster) can then be automated. You can also make an index of projects, which would link to these data indexes, such that one single file will comprehend links to all your outputs.

## 4. Backup plans

Of course all these efforts will be in vain, if the data is lost completely: indeed
computer are not to be trusted, they can break, they can be stolen, they can burn or be drown. You therefore should make sure that if anything happens, your data will still be safe. The basic rule of 3 copies on at least 2 different locations can save a PhD.
