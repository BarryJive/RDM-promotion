# Introduction

(video with lion)
You may think your data will stand out and will be easy to find, but the reality is that your digitalised data will blend in and no one will scream at its view.
In order to make sure your data is not loss, and that you will always find it easily when you need it, it takes some organisation and planning.

So put data on a leash with your data management.

## 1. Data folder organisation

In three years, you will probably need access to the data you are collecting now, and in three years, you will have produced a lot more data: it might be difficult to find your files again.
Diverse solution need to be implemented to facilitate the task. 
Using a heirarchy of folders to organsise your files is one of them. For instance, you can use one folder per project, as well as subfolders for raw data, secondary data, analyses and reports. In any case, writing a readme file explaining how the data is organised makes it easier and faster to understand where is which version of the data and analysis.


## 2. Data file naming

File names should be as short as possible, as long as necessary, i.e. they should be self explanatory. Never use special characters like spaces or points. 
Use conventions for naming your files, and make sure you and your co-workers are using the same ones.
Pro tip: If you want to use dates, use the standard yyyymmdd, such that sorting files by their names will correspond to their chronology. 

## 3. Data index and metadata

Conventions are good, but they are nearly always failing. A practical way to go around the problem is to create an index of files, where metadata information can be added and which can be read by a computer. Small programs will be able to reach to the data only by reading the index and operations like concatenating tabular data, joining tables, analysing data and producing figures (for the production of manuscript, presentation and poster) can then be automated. You can also make an index of projects, which would link to these data indexes, such that one single file will comprehend links to all your outputs.

## 4. Backup plans

Of course all these efforts will be in vain, if the data is lost completely: indeed
computer are not to be trusted, they can break, they can be stolen, they can burn or be drown. You therefore should make sure that if anything happens, your data will still be safe. The basic rule of 3 copies on at least 2 different locations can save a PhD.
