Our research field, glass science, is not a big research field, but several researchers worldwide have benefitted from our data repository. It is known in the glass community that if you have an idea or theory, you can go to our website and download data. We ask people to send us an email if they download and use the data. Sometimes they don’t do that, however, as we can track how many people have downloaded the data, but we can see in the references or acknowledgements of several published papers that people have made use of our data. As an example, yesterday we had a visitor from the USA, who had collected data from three groups for his purpose, including our data.
